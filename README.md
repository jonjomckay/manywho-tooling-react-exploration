ManyWho Tooling React Exploration
=================================

This is just a little pet project for me to learn both React and modern JavaScript practices, using an API that I know
inside and out - the [ManyWho Draw API](http://manywho.github.io/slate/#draw).

It's probably atrocious quality and doesn't work in a lot of places, but it's all part of the journey!

## Usage

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000` and you should have a dashboard.
