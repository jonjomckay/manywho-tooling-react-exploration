ManyWho Tooling React Exploration
=================================

This is just a little project for me to learn both React and modern JavaScript practices, using an API that I know
inside and out - the ManyWho Draw API.

It's probably atrocious quality and doesn't work in a lot of places, but it's all part of the journey!

## Usage

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000` and you should have a dashboard.
